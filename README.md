Chiron Hei HK
=============

Chiron Hei HK (昭源黑體) is a Traditional Chinese sans typeface based on [Adobe](https://adobe.com/)’s [Source Han Sans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans) (a.k.a. [Google](https://www.google.com)’s [Noto Sans CJK](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-cjk/)). The font aims at providing a modern, region-agnostic glyph set adopting the “modern” glyph style that is similar to the prevailing, usually commercial, typefaces in the Traditional Chinese regions.
